#Molecular Disparities Between Cancer Patients with Normal Weight and Excessive Body Fat

All the coded is performed under platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0, and R version 3.6.1.
Characterization of molecular differences between normal weight and overweight/obese cancer patients. 

1.	A comprehensive analysis of molecular differences between patients with overweight/obesity and normal-weight patients in 14 different cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
2.	The effects of potential confounding factors were eliminated and overweight/obesity-associated molecular features were faithfully explained.
